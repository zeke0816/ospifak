# OSPIFAK

This project runs on the Bun or Node.js runtime environment and features Vue.js, Vite, and Tailwind CSS with JavaScript (not TypeScript) for simplicity.

This is not meant to be functional, we will only write mock-ups because it's faster than any other tool like Figma when you know what you're doing.

## Bun

Much faster than NPM when installing dependencies.

[Bun's website](https://bun.sh)

```shell
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash # install bun for the first time
```

```shell
bun install # install or update dependencies
```

```shell
bun upgrade # upgrade bun itself
```

```shell
bun run dev # compile for development
```

```shell
bun run build # compile for production
```

## NPM / Node.js

[Node.js download webpage](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

```shell
npm install # install or update dependencies
```

```shell
npm run dev # compile for development
```

```shell
npm run build # compile for production
